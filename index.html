          <li>Teaching ninth-grade science at a newly created NYC public school brought me into contact with quite<a href="https://youtu.be/0HjWIxzjcrI" class="bg-info"> a few characters</a> and really energizing students and staff.</li>
          <li>Past employment also includes administering psychiatric care as a child psychiatric aide at a Missouri state-run residential psychiatric hospital,</li>
